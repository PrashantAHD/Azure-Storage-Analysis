# Azure Storage Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Azure Storage usage and costs. It processes Azure storage data, generates enhanced reports, and offers actionable recommendations to optimize storage usage and reduce costs.

## Analysis Scope
- **Data Sources:**
  - Raw Azure storage usage and billing CSV exports
  - Enhanced Excel reports generated by the analysis script
- **Metrics Analyzed:**
  - Storage account usage (by type, region, and SKU)
  - Cost breakdowns (monthly, by resource, by storage class)
  - Growth trends and historical usage
  - Unused or underutilized storage resources
  - Recommendations for cost savings and optimization

## Recommendations Provided
- Identify unused or infrequently accessed storage accounts and blobs
- Suggest moving data to lower-cost storage tiers (e.g., Cool, Archive)
- Highlight opportunities for lifecycle management and automation
- Recommend deletion or consolidation of redundant resources
- Provide insights on data redundancy and geo-replication settings

## Files in This Repository
- `azure_storage_analysis.py`: Main analysis script
- `azure_storage_analysis_*.csv`: Raw Azure storage data exports
- `azure_storage_analysis_enhanced_*.xlsx`: Enhanced analysis reports

## How to Run the Analysis

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (see below)
- Azure storage usage CSV export (download from Azure Portal)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone git@github.com:PrashantAHD/Azure-Storage-Analysis.git
   cd Azure-Storage-Analysis
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required packages:

   ```
   If `requirements.txt` is not present, install common dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

### Usage
1. Place your Azure storage CSV export in the project directory.
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```powershell
   python azure_storage_analysis.py
   ```
3. The script will generate an enhanced Excel report with recommendations.

### Output
- Enhanced Excel report: `azure_storage_analysis_enhanced_<date>.xlsx`
- Summary and recommendations are included in the report

## Customization
- Modify `azure_storage_analysis.py` to adjust analysis logic or add new metrics
- Update the script to support additional data sources or output formats as needed
